- AI-Powered Task Description Generation: Use the Gemini API to generate a detailed task description based on the task title, acting as a tool to assist users in elaborating on their tasks.
- AI-Driven Task Priority Assignment: Employ the Gemini API to determine task priority (High, Medium, Low) based on the task title and description, giving the user a tool that will give better insights and organization.
- Task Card Display: Display task cards with clear titles, AI-generated descriptions, and assigned priorities within each Kanban column.
